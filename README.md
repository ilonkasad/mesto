### Project: Mesto: JS/OOP/Webpack

The project was carried out in the process of studying such topics as:
- OOP basics, application in interfaces
- Modules in JS
- JS and destructuring
- Building a project with Webpack, transpilation and minification of CSS and JS

### Developing locally (Quick Start)
If you want to work on the library locally:

1. Fork this repository and clone your version of the repo
2. Install npm dependencies
  npm install
3. Start library build in the watch mode. This command will start microbundle in watch mode, meaning that everytime you make changes to the source of the library it will be compiled to dist folder
  npm run dev

If everything went well, you now have documentation running on http://localhost:8080/

Please be patient, loading is long due to API resources
